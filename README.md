# Project Euler
First of all if you are looking for solutions because you are stuck, please don't. You'll learn more by trying to work through and solve the issues yourself rather than copying from another person's solution. Especially when it's me because there are a lot of smarter people out there with much nicer solutions than mine.

This repository merely holds my attempts to work through project euler with the Go programming language, it's primary purpose is for my own education into the language.
